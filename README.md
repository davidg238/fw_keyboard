# Keyboard FeatherWing Rev 2

This library enables the Solder Party [Keyboard FeatherWing Rev 2](https://www.solder.party/docs/keyboard-featherwing/rev2/) to be used with ESP32 FeatherWings running [Toit](https://toit.io/).  
FeatherWings tested and known to work:  
- [Adafruit HUZZAH32 - ESP32 Feather Board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3405)

## Wiring 

Plug the ESP32 feather into the back of the Featherwing Keyboard.

## Notes
1. This version contains the first working version of a UI framework, drawing very loosely upon Elm-UI, Flutter and HotDraw.  
In /examples, execute `jag run ui_demo.toit` to see.  
Review `ui_view_tft.toit` for a fragment of `tft.toit` recoded using the framework.  Sofar, only Text elements are implemented.  

2. A simple tank simulation and PID control is available in `tank_ioctl.toit` and presented as a service, installed with `jag container install ioctl tank_ioctl.toit`.   
Execute `jag run tank_ui.toit` and view `jag monitor`, to see the tank level/setpoint/control output printed.  
The level simulation is updated every 6 seconds, the PID runs every 2.
