# Keyboard FeatherWing Rev 2

This library enables the [Adafruit HUZZAH32 - ESP32 Feather Board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3405) to be used with the Solder Party [Keyboard FeatherWing Rev 2](https://www.solder.party/docs/keyboard-featherwing/rev2/)

## Wiring 

Plug the ESP32 feather into the back of the Featherwing Keyboard.

## Status

Display and keyboard working minimally.
Toy graphics hierarchy to demonstrate interactivity, understand language syntax.

## ToDo
 - fillout pages 1,2,3, with decent examples: TextEntryField + tab order; graphics using 5way; touch tracking
 - make touchscreen code robust, currently errors occasionally

## Known Issues
 - the keyboard ALS does not work, because ESP32 Feather pin 26 is not supported as an Analog Input by Toit
